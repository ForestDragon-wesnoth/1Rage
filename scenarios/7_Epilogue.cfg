And suddenly, the Sun rose. The rays of dawn illuminated the empty battlefield, where only my panting squad remained. We had destroyed the sand skulkers souls, and now there was nothing left of them."

Dreamed of those whom we lost. We dreamed of our campaign, the images were disordered and lost in a blood-red shroud. I saw my father."

Along the way, we stumbled upon things never heard before: peoples rebelled against the deserters, ravaged their caravans, burned their settlements and battled them, just like us. I never imagined that our fury would ignite the flames of strife among the non-drakes."

From every corner, brave chieftains come to me and want to continue the war against the deserters. I will help them. We will gather the army of all the south and drive the deserters into the most distant and lifeless sands. And only when this is done, will I return to the Primordial Fire and tell the tribe that their sacrifice was not in vain."
