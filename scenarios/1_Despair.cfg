            story= _ "Dunefolk... In the old days, few people heard of this conglomerate of southern tribes; no one cared about their endless clan wars, their primitive nomadic culture. The life of the desert nomads did not go beyond their own sands. But time passed. Strong tribes subjugated the weak. Gradually, the united power of the desert has been raising its head from the dunes."

            story= _ "When the Eastern Invasion of Wesnoth ended, the dunefolk had already made their presence known throughout the South. The ubiquitous caravans spoke of themselves as a nation of traders, scholars, and explorers. They told of great prosperous cities and wise rulers who had rejected cruel clan laws. But that is their word. What can say those who have encountered the dunefolk personally?"
